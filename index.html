<h3> ABOUT ME </h3>
    <p> I'm just a 19 year-old guy from Utah that enjoys programming and <br/> 
        trying to make a career out of it. I also enjoy working on cars
        <br/> and playing with my dog. I currently work full-time at Solcius as <br/> a Production
        Control Manager.

    <h2> I LOVE SOCCER </h2>

    <span> I'm still learning a lot about software development (especially git) 
        but I'm excited to be able to bring my ideas to life </span>

        <pre>  I'm not too sure what the point of &lt;pre&gt; is </pre>
        <p> is it just the font that's different about it? </p>
